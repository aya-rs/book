eBPF is a technology that allows running user-supplied programs inside the Linux
kernel. For more info see the ["What is eBPF?" documentation][what-is-ebpf].

Aya is an eBPF library built with a focus on operability and developer
experience. It does not rely on [libbpf] nor [bcc] - it's built from the ground
up purely in Rust, using only the [libc] crate to execute syscalls. With BTF
support and when linked with musl, it offers a true [compile once, run
everywhere solution][co-re], where a single self-contained binary can be
deployed on many linux distributions and kernel versions.

Some of the major features provided include:

* Support for the **BPF Type Format** (BTF), which is transparently enabled when
  supported by the target kernel. This allows eBPF programs compiled against
  one kernel version to run on different kernel versions without the need to
  recompile.
* Support for function call relocation and global data maps, which
  allows eBPF programs to make **function calls** and use **global variables
  and initializers**.
* **Async support** with both [tokio] and [async-std].
* Easy to deploy and fast to build: aya doesn't require a kernel build or
  compiled headers, and not even a C toolchain; a release build completes in a matter
  of seconds.

for IoT. See more [here][pulsar-github].

### [![Kubernetes SIGs][kubernetes-logo]{ width="150" }][kubernetes-sigs]

The [Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIGs)][kubernetes-sigs] are using Aya
to develop [Blixt][blixt], a load-balancer that supports the development and
maintenance of the [Gateway API project][gateway-api].
