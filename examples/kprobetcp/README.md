# kprobetcp

A test eBPF Aya-based Rust program that attached a bpf handler to kprobe on
`tcp_connect` and prints the source and destination IP addreses from the
sockets for the TCP connections (IPv4 and IPv6).

## Prerequisites

1. Install a rust stable toolchain: `rustup install stable`
1. Install a rust nightly toolchain: `rustup install nightly`
1. Install bpf-linker: `cargo install bpf-linker`

## Build eBPF

    ```console
    cargo xtask build-ebpf
    ```

To perform a release build you can use the `--release` flag.
You may also change the target architecture with the `--target` flag.

## Build Userspace

    ```console
    cargo build
    ```

## Run

    ```console
    RUST_LOG=info cargo xtask run
    ```

Execute some TCP connection in a different terminal, such as
`curl http://example.com`. The expected output (the source IP address will
likely be different):
